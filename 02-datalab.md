# Datalab overview
## Data Exploration
Cloud Datalab is a powerful interactive tool created to explore, analyze, transform and visualize data and build machine learning models on Google Cloud Platform. It runs on Google Compute Engine and connects to multiple cloud services easily so you can focus on your data science tasks.
## Integrated & Open Source
Cloud Datalab is built on Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython). Notebooks are documents which contain both computer code (Python, SQL, and JavaScript) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

Datalab notebooks simplifies data processing with Cloud BigQuery, Cloud Machine Learning Engine, Cloud Storage, and Stackdriver Monitoring. Authentication, cloud computation and source control are taken care of out-of-the-box.
## Pricing
There is no charge for using Google Cloud Datalab. However, you do pay for any Google Cloud Platform resources you use with Cloud Datalab, for example:
* Compute resources: The default Cloud Datalab VM machine type is n1-standard-1. You are also charged for a 20GB VM Boot Disk +  200GB Standard Persistent Disk, where user notebooks are stored. 200GB disk remains after the deletion of the VM until you delete it. The following command deletes the VM instance and 20GB boot disk as well as the 200GB user notebook disk.
```
datalab delete --delete-disk instance-name
```
* Storage resources: Notebooks are saved to Persistent Disk and backed up to Google Cloud Storage
* Data Analysis Services: You incur Google BigQuery costs when issuing SQL queries. Also, when you use Google Cloud Machine Learning, you may incur Cloud Machine Learning Engine and/or Google Cloud Dataflow charges.
* Other resources: You may incur costs for other API requests you make within the Cloud Datalab notebook environment.
