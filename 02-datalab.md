# Datalab
## Data Exploration
Cloud Datalab is a powerful interactive tool created to explore, analyze, transform and visualize data and build machine learning models on Google Cloud Platform. It runs on Google Compute Engine and connects to multiple cloud services easily so you can focus on your data science tasks.
## Integrated & Open Source
Cloud Datalab is built on Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython). Notebooks are documents which contain both computer code (Python, SQL, and JavaScript) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

Datalab notebooks simplifies data processing with Cloud BigQuery, Cloud Machine Learning Engine, Cloud Storage, and Stackdriver Monitoring. Authentication, cloud computation and source control are taken care of out-of-the-box.
